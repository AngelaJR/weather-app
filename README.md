# Weather App

This React weather app offers real-time weather updates and can fetch current weather conditions based on your location. Users can search for weather information for any location or use the appâ€™s geolocation feature to see weather details for their current position. The app displays key data such as temperature, humidity, and weather description, and includes a forecast for the upcoming days.
